Code for assessing soil physiochemical and microbial responses to a photovoltaic array

Code is split into assessment of soil physiochemistry, soil bacteria/archaea (16S), and soil fungi (ITS). There is an RMD script for each of these, along with QIIME2 scripts for each amplicon (16S/ITS). 

Please reach out to jasiggers@yahoo.com with any questions.
